A blog website is a platform where people can share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences through written content.
In a blog website where the admin can post blogs, the admin is responsible for creating and publishing the articles. The admin has full control over the content that is published on the website.
To create a blog website where the admin can post blogs, the website would typically consist of a backend system that allows the admin to create, edit, and publish articles. The backend system would also allow the admin to manage the users and blogs.
